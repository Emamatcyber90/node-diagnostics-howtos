### Goal

This repo is for putting all the intricate bits of knowledge about diagnosing what happens to node applications performance and memory etc. in one place.

- short documents
- link only to resources that should stay up
- make recognizing what's outdated easy
- make it useful as notes for someone who knows it already but needs details to be able to teach others without preparation
